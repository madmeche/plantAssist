# Foliage Finder

What areas should a basic Readme cover?
Every readme should cover at least the following:

A description of what the project is about
How it looks (screenshots 📷, gifs, etc.)
Instructions on how to run or use it👨‍💻
Should contain other relevant details (code samples, tech framework, credits, etc.)

About the Project: 📚 (The problem)
Horticulture is (or can be) a beautiful blend of science and art. 
It  can require years of practice growing plants in different environments to master it.
So, horticulture seemed to be for people with passion and patience to pursue it. 

But everyone should be able to enjoy it.

Horticulture is a branch of agriculture, and covers a wide range of plants, so it seemed best to narrow it down to specifics. Out of the four main branches, I opted to learn more about floriculture, and landscaping.


The Solution:

Foliage Finder was developed to take guess work out of home gardening.

This app can save new gardeners or even experienced landscapers time and money by reducing the options for planting in specific areas.

There are other popular plant apps on the market
But they are only able to identify an unknown plant, 
or give possible causes to for a sick plant. 

This app helps prevent certain plant illnesses by providing ample information and filtering by plants that are adequate for specific areas.


Setup / Installation: 
Install Node.js.
Install MySQL.
Clone this Repo.

In mySQL workbench, create a new schema called
plant_assist


Create .env file:
PORT = 8080
DB_NAME = plant_assist
DB_USER = *users*
DB_PASSWORD = *users*
DB_HOST = localhost
DB_PORT = 3306
