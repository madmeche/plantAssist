# Foliage Finder

# About the Project
Horticulture is (or can be) a beautiful blend of science and art. 
It  can require years of practice growing plants in different environments to master it.
So, horticulture seemed to be for people with passion and patience to pursue it. 

But everyone should be able to enjoy it.

Horticulture is a branch of agriculture, and covers a wide range of plants, so it seemed best to narrow it down to specifics. Out of the four main branches, I opted to learn more about floriculture, and landscaping.


# The Solution

Foliage Finder was developed to take guess work out of home gardening.

This app can save new gardeners or even experienced landscapers time and money by reducing the options for planting in specific areas.

There are other popular plant apps on the market
But they are only able to identify an unknown plant, 
or give possible causes to for a sick plant. 

This app helps prevent certain plant illnesses by providing ample information and filtering by plants that are adequate for specific areas.


# Setup / Installation: 
Install Node.js.
Install MySQL.
Clone this Repo.

# Status
Foliage Finder is still under construction with plans to include what seems like an endless amount of plants to choose from for the entire US.
